This changes everything for institutional crypto.\n\nAnchorage Digital, Kamino, and Solana Company announced the first framework letting institutions borrow against natively staked SOL while keeping assets in qualified custody AND earning staking yield.\n\nThink about the implications:\n\n• Your SOL stays staked, earning ~7% APY\n\n• You borrow against it for working capital\n\n• Assets never leave qualified custody (regulatory box checked)\n\n• You maintain upside exposure to SOL price appreciation\n\nThis is the blueprint every institutional treasury has been waiting for.\n\nTraditional finance has always struggled with crypto's \"either/or\" problem - either earn yield OR maintain liquidity. This framework says \"both.\"\n\nAt Phase Labs, we run massive staked SOL operations. Seeing institutional-grade capital efficiency solutions emerge validates everything we've built around validator infrastructure and liquid staking.\n\nThe institutions that adopt this model first will have a massive competitive advantage.

You write CI/CD in plain Markdown, and agents execute everything else.\n\nThis isn't just another developer tool. It's a fundamental shift in how we think about software development. The most successful engineering teams will be those who learn to work alongside AI agents, not those who resist them.\n\nWe're moving from continuous integration to continuous intelligence. The companies that understand this distinction will build faster, ship better software, and attract top engineering talent who want to work with cutting-edge tooling.",

Among the crypto heavyweights: Anatoly Yakovenko from Solana Labs.\n\nWhy does this matter?\n\nThe CFTC has traditionally been more crypto-friendly than the SEC. If crypto regulation shifts toward CFTC jurisdiction (which many hope), having Anatoly's voice in those conversations is huge for the entire Solana ecosystem.\n\nThis isn't just about token prices. It's about legitimacy at the highest levels of US financial policy.\n\nAt Phase Labs, we operate 30+ Solana validators. We've seen firsthand how regulatory clarity drives institutional adoption.\n\nWhen major funds can stake SOL through their brokerage accounts (21Shares just announced SOL ETF staking rewards), when enterprises can build on Solana without regulatory uncertainty, when developers can ship without legal risk - that's when real growth happens.\n\nRegulation isn't the enemy of innovation. Bad regulation is.\n\nHaving builders like Anatoly shaping policy instead of just reacting to it? That's how we get it right.\n\n---",

For years, institutions wanted crypto exposure but couldn't access native yields. You could buy BTC through an ETF, but you couldn't stake it.\n\nThat limitation just disappeared for Solana.\n\nNow pension funds, family offices, and retail investors can earn 6-8% APY on SOL through their existing brokerage relationship. No need to learn validator selection, delegation, or custody.\n\nAt Phase Labs, we manage over 1 million SOL in delegation. We've watched institutional interest grow as compliance barriers dropped.\n\nBut yield access was the missing piece. Traditional investors understand dividends and bond yields. They don't understand staking - until it shows up as a line item on their quarterly statement.\n\nThis is how crypto goes mainstream. Not through flashy marketing campaigns, but through familiar financial products that reduce friction to zero.\n\nThe line between traditional finance and DeFi isn't blurring. It's disappearing entirely.\n\n---",
