The market is finally pricing in what business leaders have been quietly discussing for months: white-collar automation isn't coming—it's here.\n\nAs someone building with AI agents daily, I see this moment differently. The panic isn't about the technology itself—it's about the speed. Companies that are already experimenting, adapting, and reimagining their workflows will thrive. Those waiting for permission or certainty will struggle.\n\nThe question isn't whether AI will transform your industry. It's whether you're building the capabilities to lead that transformation or just hoping to survive it.",

You write CI/CD in plain Markdown, and agents execute everything else.\n\nThis isn't just another developer tool. It's a fundamental shift in how we think about software development. The most successful engineering teams will be those who learn to work alongside AI agents, not those who resist them.\n\nWe're moving from continuous integration to continuous intelligence. The companies that understand this distinction will build faster, ship better software, and attract top engineering talent who want to work with cutting-edge tooling.",
