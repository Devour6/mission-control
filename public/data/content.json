The market is finally pricing in what business leaders have been quietly discussing for months: white-collar automation isn't coming\u2014it's here.\n\nAs someone building with AI agents daily, I see this moment differently. The panic isn't about the technology itself\u2014it's about the speed. Companies that are already experimenting, adapting, and reimagining their workflows will thrive. Those waiting for permission or certainty will struggle.\n\nThe question isn't whether AI will transform your industry. It's whether you're building the capabilities to lead that transformation or just hoping to survive it.",

The most successful engineering teams will be those who learn to work alongside AI agents, not those who resist them.\n\nWe're moving from continuous integration to continuous intelligence.
