Ethereum does ~15 TPS. Bitcoin does ~7 TPS.\n\nThis isn't just about speed - it's about what becomes possible. Real-time trading, instant settlements, AI agents transacting at machine speed.

Firedancer has demonstrated 1M TPS in testing environments. This isn't incremental improvement - it's infrastructure for applications that can't exist today.\n\nReal-time trading, microsecond arbitrage, instant settlement for payments - these become possible when blockchain operates at network speeds rather than consensus delays.

The bounce from $60K was fueled by cooler inflation data, but the real signal is in who's buying versus who's selling.\n\n**Body:** The $8.7B liquidation event on Feb 5 cleared out leveraged positions and shook retail confidence. Fear & Greed Index remains in \"extreme fear\" despite the recovery. But institutional flows tell a different story - crypto ETFs are seeing steady accumulation even as sentiment deteriorates.\n\nThis is textbook institutional behavior: buy the panic, accumulate during fear, position for the next cycle. JPMorgan's crypto team just released bullish guidance for the rest of 2026, citing institutional flows as the primary recovery driver. While retail focuses on daily price action, smart money builds positions for longer horizons.\n\n**Rationale:** Broader crypto market analysis with institutional focus.
