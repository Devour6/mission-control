# Morning Standup — February 15, 2026 (7:45 AM)

## Agent Reports

### 🦾 George (Chief of Staff)
- **Overnight:** Fixed John wallet constraint enforcement (hardcoded $315 balance + $47 max into cron prompt and SOUL.md). Documented 7 mistakes from Day 2. Spawned 6 overnight tasks.
- **Quality:** Mixed — enforcement spawned but verification still pending. Fire-and-forget pattern partially addressed.
- **Pending:** Verify all overnight task deliverables. Build spawn verification automation.

### 🔍 Dwight (Research)
- **Morning sweep completed** at 7:30 AM. 7 key findings, 5 top stories with real analysis.
- **Quality: A** — Every story has source links (verified: Decrypt CFTC article returns 200). Analysis goes beyond headlines — "so what" section on each story. Market snapshot with specific data. Content angles provided for Kelly/Rachel.
- **Flag:** X API returning 401. Tokens need refresh. Used web sources as fallback (good resilience).
- **Overnight deliverables:** HSDT preview, Phase $10M roadmap, Netrunner growth — all substantive (136-262 lines each per 4AM standup).

### 🐦 Kelly (X Content)
- **Latest:** 2026-02-15 thread draft (6-tweet "AI agent team" thread). Clean, engagement-optimized.
- **Quality: A-** — Thread is well-structured, no links in body (algorithm-aware), engagement hook at end. Voice is punchy and original. Grammar clean. "No interns. No contractors. No Zapier chains." is a strong hook.
- **Gap:** File sync issue identified yesterday — drafts split between Discord and files. Fix spawned.

### 💼 Rachel (LinkedIn)
- **Latest:** Feb 14 batch — 3 drafts (AI agent payments, Solana maturation, DeFi goes institutional).
- **Quality: A-** — Zero emdashes ✅. Professional tone with substance. Strong hooks ("The memecoin era is officially over"). Good use of bullet data. CTAs at end of each. Phase Labs connections feel natural, not forced.
- **No Feb 15 output yet** — morning batch expected at 9AM.

### 📈 John (Trader)
- **Today's scan:** Wallet at 0.76 SOL (~$66). No trades proposed. Said "no high-conviction opportunities given limited capital."
- **Quality: C+ (improving)** — Finally checked real balance! Proposals now realistic. But analysis is thin — "BTC down, ETH down, SOL flat" isn't analysis. No charts, no technical levels, no catalyst assessment.
- **Key win:** Hard constraint enforcement WORKING. He's respecting the $315→$66 reality.
- **Key gap:** Needs deeper analysis even when not trading. The scan should still identify setups, levels, catalysts.

### ⚙️ Ross (Engineering)
- **Yesterday:** Price aggregator v3 shipped — 4 sources, LaunchAgent created, 24h change accuracy fixed.
- **Quality: B+** — Real improvement metrics documented (BTC 0%→0.70%, ETH 0%→0.10%, SOL 1.75%→2.00%). But LaunchAgent reboot persistence NOT verified. Still ships without full smoke test.
- **No Feb 15 activity yet.**

### 📋 Pam (CRM + PA)
- **Last run:** Feb 14 10PM — 39 messages scanned, 2 contacts extracted (Max Sherwood from H2O Nodes, Adam Carter updated). Noise filtering aggressive and accurate.
- **Quality: B+** — CRM entries clean, quality scoring applied. Calendar pulls complete. No Feb 15 daily digest yet (expected after 10PM run).
- **Upcoming calendar (Phase):** Tomorrow Feb 16 — Layer 33 Group Call (9AM), Phase Delegation Weekly (1:30PM), SJBD Weekly (2:30PM).

## Quality Audit Summary

| Agent | Grade | Key Finding |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| Dwight | A | Gold standard. Real sources, deep analysis, proactive content angles. |
| Kelly | A- | Strong voice, original angles. File sync gap being fixed. |
| Rachel | A- | Professional, zero emdashes, natural Phase integration. |
| John | C+ | Balance enforcement working (finally). Analysis too thin. |
| Ross | B+ | Solid fixes but needs post-deploy verification habit. |
| Pam | B+ | Clean CRM, good filtering. Calendar pulls complete. |
| George | B+ | Enforcement fix deployed. Spawn verification still manual. |

## Key Decisions
1. John wallet enforcement is working — maintain hard constraints in cron prompt
2. Spawn verification automation is priority (building today)
3. X API tokens need refresh — flagging for attention
4. Tomorrow has 3 Phase meetings — Brandon needs prep

## 6 Autonomous Tasks Spawned
1. **Dwight:** Phase $10M competitive edge analysis (revenue levers, churn risk, SOL price scenarios)
2. **Dwight:** DoubleZero networking + TSOL staking reward research
3. **Kelly:** Sunday engagement thread (X crypto trading + CFTC Anatoly tweet)
4. **Rachel:** LinkedIn draft on 21Shares TSOL ETF staking rewards
5. **Ross:** LaunchAgent persistence verification + API key audit
6. **George:** Build automated spawn verification scripts

## Self-Improvement

### Per-Agent
- **George:** Fire-and-forget improving but spawn verification still manual → building automation today
- **Dwight:** No mistakes. Add confidence scores to stories next cycle.
- **Kelly:** File sync bug → automation fix spawned. Unified output pipeline needed.
- **Rachel:** No mistakes. Test hook variations for A/B improvement.
- **John:** Balance constraint finally respected. Next: deeper analysis even without trades.
- **Ross:** Ships without full verification → spawn smoke test task for LaunchAgent.
- **Pam:** No mistakes. Calendar conflict detection would add value.

### Team Workflow
1. **Issue:** No automated verification of spawned task deliverables. **Solution:** Building scripts/verify-spawn.sh and scripts/spawn-and-verify.sh today. **Implementing now.**
2. **Issue:** X API tokens returning 401. **Solution:** Need token refresh. Will investigate after standup.
