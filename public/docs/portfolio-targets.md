# Brandon's Portfolio Targets

## Bear Market Strategy: ACCUMULATE

### Target Holdings
- **20 staked ETH**
- **3 oz Oro digital gold**
- **1 kilo silver**
- **2 BTC**
- **1x Pudgy Penguin NFT**
- **1x Mad Lad**
- **1x Milady**
- **10k shyUSD**

### Current DCA Schedule (Monthly)
- BTC: $150 via Coinbase
- ETH: $150 via Coinbase

### Solana Positions
- 4 personal validators: Ded Monkes (85%), Gojira (62.5%), Nebula (62.5%), Kisetsu (85%)
- Validator income is variable — some months $20k+, some months a few thousand
- CRT token — yield-bearing stablecoin (hold)

### Rules
- Stack during bear market while prices are low
- Don't sell validators or staked positions
- DCA is king — lump sum only on extreme dips (>20% drawdown from local high)
- Max 15% of portfolio per single trade
- Preserve capital first, deploy second

### Expanded Trading Authority
- **Can buy ANY token** if proper analysis supports it (not just BTC/ETH/SOL)
- **Can long or short on Jupiter** perps if the setup is there
- **Required due diligence before ANY trade:**
  1. Liquidity check — is there enough depth to enter AND exit?
  2. X/CT sentiment — what's the crowd saying? Use x-research skill
  3. On-chain data — holder distribution, whale movements, TVL if applicable
  4. Chart analysis — TradingView screenshots, support/resistance, volume
  5. Risk/reward — clear thesis, stop loss level, take profit target
- **No memecoins without extreme conviction** — liquidity dries up fast, need clear catalyst
- **Shorts require extra scrutiny** — funding rates, open interest, liquidation levels

### Phase Products
- **$YIELD (phaseSOL)** — Phase's LST. If holding liquid staked SOL, USE THIS. Support the home team.
- **pdSOL** — Phase Delegation token. DO NOT TRADE — this is a company product, not a trading position.
