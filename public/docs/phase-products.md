## $YIELD
- Could not find a separate $YIELD token from Phase Labs in public sources
- phaseSOL appears to be the liquid staking token
- John's trading instructions say "must use $YIELD for liquid staked SOL" — this may be an internal/upcoming product name
- **Need to ask Brandon for clarification on $YIELD vs phaseSOL**

## Key Differences
- **phaseSOL** = liquid staking through Phase's single validator (7.7% APY)
- **pdSOL** = Phase Delegation pool across 166 validators (5.79% APY, ~1M SOL TVL)
- pdSOL is the larger program — Phase Delegation manages ~1M SOL across the ecosystem
- phaseSOL is more concentrated (single validator) but higher APY
- **John's rule: pdSOL = DO NOT TRADE** (it's the delegation program, not a personal holding)
